# Iris Flower Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Overview**

This project presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Iris Flower Dataset, one of the most famous datasets in pattern recognition and machine learning. The analysis walks through all key steps in understanding the structure, distribution, and statistical relationships within the data.

*It includes:*

- Data loading and inspection
- Data cleaning and preprocessing 
- Visual exploration
- Descriptive statistical analysis
- Inferential statistical analysis

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate data exploration and statistical analysis skills in Python using standard data science libraries.
